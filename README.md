# tuberculosis_detection_using-random-forest
An ML model to classify given X-ray images of lungs into tuberculosis-infected and non-infected was built using a random forest classifier. Image processing and image segmentation were done as preprocessing methods to achieve an accuracy of 95% from the ML model.
